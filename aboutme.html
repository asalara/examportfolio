        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Ever since I was a child I have been drawing, painting, writing poems, creating stuff and daydreaming. I grew up in Reykjavik, ICELAND and moved to Denmark in 2015 with my husband and two kids. It had always been my dream to broaden my horizon and move to another country, and at the age of 37 I finally did it ! </p>

        <p>I love every aspect of art and design and have always been very creative. I have done alot of oil and acrylic paintings through the years and I love sitting with my sketchbook and drawing. My passion is graphic design, layout design and illustrations. I would also like to dive deeper into logo design and branding.</p>

        <p>Web design is new to my and I belive I will develop good skills, even great skills as I proceed on that journey</p>

        <p>I get my inspiration from my children, music, Icelandic nature, films and books.</p>
